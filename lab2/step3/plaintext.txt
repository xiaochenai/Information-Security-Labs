Qhishing Explained
Phishing scams are typically fraudulent e-mail messages appearing to come from legitimate sources like your bank, your Internet Service Provider, eBay, or PayPal, for example. These messages usually direct you to a fake web site and ask you for private information (e.g., password, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft.
Warning Signs
There are often signs that can tip you off that a message may not be what it appears. The hints below can help you avoid "taking the bait."
Urgent Language - Phishing attempts often use language meant to alarm. They contain threats, urging you to take immediate action.  “You MUST click on the link below or your account will be canceled.?
The Greeting - If the message doesn't specifically address you by name, be wary.   Fake messages use general greetings like “Dear eBay Member?or “Attention Citibank Customer?or no greeting at all.
URLs Don’t Match - Place your mouse over the link in the e-mail message.  If the URL displayed in the window of your browser is not exactly the same as the text of the link provided in the message, run.  It’s probably a fake.   Sometimes the URLs do match and the URL is still a fake.
